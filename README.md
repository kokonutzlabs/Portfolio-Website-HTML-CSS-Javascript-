# Personal-Portfolio
Hey,
I have been trying to learn coding since 2019, but I had no idea how to actually learn it. I was just memorizing, and with so much syntax to learn, it was inefficient. In 2022 I took a C++ class and loved 
it, but I still didn’t really learn how coding works. Then last year, instead of studying, I just did and made my own website. Even though I used other scripts and help, I did start to learn how coding 
works.

Then I took a Business Programming I course this past summer for Python, and since it’s widely used, I finally understood how coding works. It also helped me further understand HTML/CSS and how they work 
as well. This site, by the way, is like the fifth version, so there’s that. It was supposed to be more professional, but that was hindering my creativity, so now I’m working on a new one that really fits 
me.
###### **I am constantly coming up with different ways to change my site, so enjoy the latest version!**
